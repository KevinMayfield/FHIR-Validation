    "title": "Diagnostic Imaging Report FHIR - FHIR API",
    "version": "0.3.0",
    "description": "## Overview\n\nThe Diagnostic Imaging Report FHIR API enables you to access a patient's diagnostic imaging reports held within hospital trusts systems in England. \nThis API is part of the wider National Imaging Registry solution in which a national registry of a patient's diagnostic imaging and associated reports \nis held in the [National Record Locator V3.0 API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/national-record-locator-fhir).\n\nIt works like this:\n\n1. Query the [National Record Locator V3.0 Consumer API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/national-record-locator-fhir/v3/consumer) to discover the patient's medical imaging history across England.\n2. Use the URLs from the NRL results to retrieve a diagnostic report (using this API).\n\nThis API can only be used in conjunction with the National Record Locator V3.0. You will first use the [National Record Locator V3.0 Consumer API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/national-record-locator-consumer-fhir) \nto search for pointers to a patient's imaging study reports, then use the information in the search results to retrieve the report from this API. \nThis removes the need for organisations to create duplicate copies of radiology reports across systems and organisations by enabling access to diagnostic imaging report \ninformation directly from the source system in a hospital trust.\n\nThe API provides only the means to retrieve a single radiology report - it does not provide a search interface as you will search for diagnostic imaging studies using the [National Record Locator V3.0 Consumer API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/national-record-locator-fhir/v3/consumer)\n\n### Data availability, timing and quality\n\nNormally, the system which is responsible for publishing details of imaging study reports to the NRL will also be the system which will provide this FHIR API.\nWhen a pointer is published to the NRL, all NRL consumers who have onboarded to consume these pointers will be able to retrieve them immediately. The expectation therefore is that when publishing a pointer, \nthe report will immediately be available for consumption by a consumer. \n\nDuring the Alpha phase, only synthetic data will be conveyed by this API. In live use, data quality will rely upon the data quality of the responsible system.\n\n## Who can use this API\n\nThis API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. You must demonstrate you have a valid use case as part of digital onboarding.\n\nClient systems must first verify NHS Numbers used in queries. This can be done either directly by\nthe client system, or by taking a feed from an upstream system which has this responsibility. In either case\nNHS Numbers used in queries must be have been verified by one of the following mechanisms:\n\n  * The [PDS FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) or the [PDS HL7 V3 API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-hl7-v3)\n  * A Spine Mini Service PDS (SMSP) Provider\n  * The [Demographics Batch Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/demographics-batch-service)\n\nConnecting parties must have an appointed Clinical Safety Officer and undertake a Clinical Safety Assessment to use this API in Beta and beyond.\n\n## API status and roadmap\n\nThis API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses) and will be tested in an Alpha phase before progressing into a Beta phase involving live patient data.\n\nTo see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our\n[interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/483146/diagnostic-imaging-report-api).\n\nIf you have any other queries, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\n## Service level\n\nThis API is a Bronze service, meaning it is operational and supported only during business hours (8am to 6pm),\nMonday to Friday, excluding bank holidays.\n\nFor more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n\n## Technology\n\nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).\n\nIt conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir)\nglobal standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except\nthat it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.\n\nIt includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which conform to\n[FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), specifically\n[fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1 0.5.1](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1/0.5.1).\n\nYou do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.\n\nIn particular, resource names are capitalised in camel case and are singular - in this API only the `DiagnosticReport` resource is used. \n\nThere are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.\n\nWe also have some request and response examples below which you could use as templates for your solution.\n\n## Network access\nThis API is available on the internet.\n\nFor more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n\n## Security and authorisation\n\nThis API uses the following access modes:\n\n* [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication) (for Integration and Live environments)\n\n## Environments and testing\n\n| Environment       | Base URL                                                               |\n| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Sandbox           | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/diagnostic-imaging-report/FHIR/R4/`  |\n| Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/diagnostic-imaging-report/FHIR/R4/`      |\n\n\n### Sandbox testing\n\nOur [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n* is for early developer testing\n* only covers a limited set of scenarios\n* is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation\n\nFor details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the\ndocumentation for each endpoint.\n\nAlternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/TBC)\n\n### Integration testing\n\nOur [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):\n\n* is for formal integration testing\n* includes authorisation\n\nIt also includes ready-to-use test data and scenarios.  For details [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\nFor more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).\n\n## Onboarding\n\nWhen used beyond the Alpha, you need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it is worth planning well ahead.\n\nAs part of this process, you need to demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your software conforms technically with the requirements for this API.\n\nInformation on this page might impact the design of your software. For details, see [Onboarding support information](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/diagnostic-imaging-report/onboarding-support-information).\n\nTo understand how our online digital onboarding process works, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding#using-the-digital-onboarding-portal).\n\nParticipants in the Alpha will not need to onboard software. The above is provided for information to inform planning beyond Alpha.\n\n## Errors\n\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server\n\nErrors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.\n",
